Did you know that GitHub Codespaces can help improve your day-to-day life as a student? Even though it’s still relatively new, Codespaces is full of new and exciting opportunities for learning—for students and teachers alike. In this course, instructor David Teather provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Codespaces, showcasing all the benefits it can bring to your projects.

Discover the fundamental skills you need to know to get the most out of this powerful tool, including how to configure a codespace and code within a codespace, regardless of your background or previous experience. Along the way, explore a handful of examples that highlight successful student use cases. Upon completing this course, you’ll be equipped with the practical know-how to assess if using a codespace makes sense for you.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. We will be using Codespaces, so you don't need to install anything locally on your own computer.
